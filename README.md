Brief 
- nmfs dir was in matlab but converted to python. Most of this was done without GenAi since they generate poor code that does not yield the exact result on matlab code tests
- evalutions.py is the inference to run all of the nmf algorithms including deep nmf using the materials date provided by Lehigh physics department
- This repo does not include the datafile since it is a large file >50 MB
